# Pokemon Battle Towers

##Introduction

This repository contains code done for the overall project as part of Centre College's
CSC 362 Database Class. This course was taught by William J. Bailey. This project uses
the LAMP stack to create this web application, I was assigned to create the Full Stack
application and design the structure of the Leaderboard system.

##Project Detail

Within this project, we were tasked with creating a battle tournament leaderboard that monitors
the longest win streak and then placed trainers based on who met that criteria. With that, I had
to create the schemas and field specifications for each Primary Key accounting for scalability when this
application reaches popularity in the Kanto region.
