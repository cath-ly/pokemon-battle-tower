# Pokemon Battle Towers

## Introduction

This repository contains code done for the overall project as part of Centre College's
CSC 362 Database Class. This course was taught by William J. Bailey. This project uses
the LAMP stack to create this web application, I was assigned to create the Full Stack
application and design the structure of the Leaderboard system.

## Project Detail

Within this project, we were tasked with creating a battle tournament leaderboard that monitors
the longest win streak and then placed trainers based on who met that criteria. With that, I had
to create the schemas and field specifications for each table accounting for scalability when this
application reaches popularity in the Kanto region. Refer to [this image](BattleTowers-Hierarchy-Structure.PNG) for the final design.

## Challenges

There were many challenges, one was finding collaborative times to meet with classmates and creating
a non-conflicting database as the class is centered on formulating a clean database. For example, 
there would be overlaps in some of the tables so we would have to be more distinct in the table to specify
the differences in each one. 

Lastly, the biggest challenge was learning to adapt when situations arise.
This project highlighted that web applications can be hard to maintain and there are many
cases, where other group members commit, would conflict with some tables that they may have
not account for, so it took time to resolve the issue and help aid teammates who were
having a hard time connecting the points. A lot of my time during these projects I would 
learn more outside my usual work times and solidify my knowledge to help others
and give them confidence, doing so made my work three times as efficient as if I were to do
solely what was my responsibility.

## What did I learn

I learned that having an RDBMS really makes things more organized and more readily accessible in mapping out how the data entries flow through
the system. Compared to a NoSQL language which solidifies unknown data appearing and being parsed, SQL helps encourage proper hierarchal structure
and a clean database system.
